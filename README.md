# Predicting Total Evictions by ZIP in San Francisco

Goals:
The goal of this project was to use time-lagged features from disparate datasets to improve planning and prediction of eviction spikes in San Francisco ZIP codes. As of August 2017, San Francisco is becoming an increasingly expensive city to rent and live in and there is a definite sense that the city's desirability and limited housing stock is leading to increases in evictions.

There are a number of hypothesis about what leads to increases in evictions and I wanted to explore possible predictors, from median home sale price in the prior year to demographic shifts based on American Community Survey data.

Ideally, this will be a resource for tenant rights' groups and city officials in terms of both planning and outreach.



The code in this repo  and plot upcoming evictions.  


The final result is the forecasting.py code, which allows you to input the number of months into the future you'd like to see and return predicted eviction totals, by ZIP, for those months.
